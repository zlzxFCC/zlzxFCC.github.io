The联系part of the index page is consisted of two elements:

<ol>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Your email address</li>
</ol>

You can modify the联系text from the /contact.html file and set the email in the site config:

<pre><code data-trim class="yaml">
email: "1280073025@qq.com"
</code></pre>

Don't be afraid of email harvesting, write your email properly and the page will perform javascript obfuscation.
